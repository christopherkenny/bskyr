## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version, I have:

- Fixed the spelling of "Application" in the description file.
- Added a spell check unit test, using the spelling package. This also adds a 
word list to the package, which includes several words describing the upstream 
API that this package interacts with.

## Test environments
