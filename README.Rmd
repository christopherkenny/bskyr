bskyr provides an interface to the Bluesky API, allowing you to interact with Bluesky Social from R. 
To do this, we provide functions which match with the [AT Protocol's Lexicon](https://atproto.com/guides/lexicon), which is like using regular HTTP requests.
Outputs from `bskyr`'s functions are primarily `tibble`s, allowing for easy analysis of the outputs from the API calls.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `bskyr` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages('devtools')
remotes::install_github('christopherkenny/bskyr')
```

## Posting with `bskyr`

```{r}
library(bskyr)
```


## Authentication

To authenticate, you first need to make an App Password. 
To do this, go to <bsky.app/settings>.
Under "Advanced" click App passwords and then "Add App Password."

Once you have a password, you need to run:

```r
set_bluesky_user('yourhandle.bsky.social')
set_bluesky_pass('the-app-password')
```

If you want this to persist across sessions, set `install = TRUE`.
This will save your credentials in your R environment file.
